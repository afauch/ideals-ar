# Ideals - Focus

## Focus

We can all relate to the experience of sitting down to make progress on a task - whether reading a book, writing a proposal, or clearing through email - only to find ourselves wandering away from the work at hand. 'Focus' is a mixed reality application built for HoloLens that promotes positive attention and focus. The user begins by dynamically wrapping their work in a 'zone of focus.' If the user becomes distracted from their task, their attention is gently guided back to their prioritized activity.
