# Ideals

MIT Media Lab
Reality Virtually Hackathon

We all have ideals that we do our best to embody - generosity, compassion, balance. But do we always live up to these ideals? Often, despite our best intentions, we struggle to make the 'best' decisions in day-to-day situations.

## Focus

'Ideals - Focus' proof-of-concept application that promotes positive behavior change in terms of attention and focus. We can all relate to the experience of sitting down to make progress on a task - whether reading a book, writing a proposal, or finishing our task - only to find ourselves wandering away from the task at hand.

'Ideals - Focus' considers how AR/MR can help users achieve a state of attention they aspire towards. The user sets a 'zone of focus' for a specific duration.
